		CD 30 comprises four Queens neighborhoods: Maspeth, Glendale, Middle Village and parts of Ridgewood. It’s home to nearly 170,000 New Yorkers who have a median household income level slightly higher than the city average.
	<p> 
		CD 30 is demographically diverse and politically multifaceted. The district’s residents are 44 percent white, 33 percent Hispanic and Latino and 18 percent Asian. Fifty percent of its voters are registered Democrats, but a 60 percent majority voted for Republican Curtis Sliwa in the 2021 general race for mayor. </p>
	<p>
		In a similar vein, departing CD 30 councilmember Robert Holden was described by Hell Gate as <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/race-to-replace-bob-holden-queens"> the council’s most conservative Democrat.</a>  After losing the Democratic primary in 2017, he ran on Republican party lines and narrowly won the general election. </p>
	<p>
		Even more unusual? The frontrunners for this year’s general election, Democrat Phil Wong and Republican Alicia Vaichunas, both work for Holden — Wong as his budget director and Vaichunas as his deputy chief of staff. Wong and Vaichunas largely overlap on policy, and Holden has even endorsed both candidates. </p>

			<h2>About Phil Wong</h2>
			<p>
				Phil Wong’s family immigrated to New York from China in 1974, and he’s lived in Elmhurst, Queens for nearly five decades. He’s a small business owner and a graduate of NYC public schools and Cornell University. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wong is sharply critical of the city’s left-leaning Democratic establishment that took shape when Bill de Blasio became mayor in 2014. After de Blasio opened migrant and homeless shelters in Elmhurst, Wong formed a community action group to protest what he called an <a href=https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16UFTGzSgN> “Illegal Alien Invasion.”</a> During the primary election, he also described mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani as <a href=https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1CSFukFkvZ> “a vile antisemite who wants to defund the police and globalize the intifada.”</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Could this sentiment sway right-wing voters in Wong’s direction? 
			</p>
			<p>
				<u> Here’s more on his platform: </u>
			</p>

		<section class="content-block">
			<h3>Education is his top priority.</h3>
			<p>
				Wong’s primary background and issue of focus is education - he was formerly the President of the Community Education Council for School District 24 in Queens. He is a staunch supporter of merit-based admissions into specialized public high schools through the SHSAT exam.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="content-block">
			<h3>He's tough on crime.</h3>
			<p>
				Wong vows to fully fund the police and restore community policing in District 30. He is against the 2019 reforms that eliminated cash bail and pretrial detention for most misdemeanors and non-violent crimes. He opposed past legislation that sought to permit non-citizen voting in municipal elections and also advocated for the return of safety agents to NYC public schools.
			</p>			
		</section>

		<section class="content-block">
			<h3>He wants to crack down on illegal immigration.</h3>
			<p>
				Wong opposes the placement of ‘unvetted migrants’ in residential neighborhoods across the city. In fact, he and other activists protested in front of the Maspeth Migrant Shelter for over a year before it closed in June 2025. Wong seeks to end New York’s status as a sanctuary city and prioritize legal residents in the provision of city services. 
			</p>
		</section>


		<section class="last">
			<h3>He supports lower taxes and stricter housing development policy.</h3>
			<p>
				Wong supports measures for affordable housing, but opposes Mayor Adams’ “City of Yes” initiative which updated NYC's zoning laws in 2024 to allow for increased housing density across the city. He believes that reducing the property and business taxes of individuals, landlords and small business owners will most effectively lower the cost of living for New Yorkers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wong also opposes the rent freeze policy proposed by the likes of Zohran Mamdani:
